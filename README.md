# Google Play statistics

Google Play statistics of a few Android apps. Click [here](https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/google-play-statistics/archive/master.zip) to download the whole data (about 2 gigabytes).

I believe this data does not contain any confidential information, but if you find any please let me know immediately, thank you!

If you find interesting things, publish a thesis or build something using the data, please [let me know](http://nrw.free.fr), that would be great :-)

## Why publish statistics?

For research purposes. Since I started publishing insight about my statistics, I started receiving many requests asking for more data, so here is all of the data. Such open data can be useful to PhD students, marketing researchers, statisticians, data enthusiasts.

If you own an app and want to add your statistics here, you are very welcome, please check [Publish my Google Play statistics](https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/publish-my-google-play-statistics) or contact me, thanks!
