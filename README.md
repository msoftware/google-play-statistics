# Google Play statistics

Google Play statistics of a few Android apps.

Exported using [Publish my Google Play statistics](https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/publish-my-google-play-statistics). 

I believe this data does not contain any confidential information, but if you find any please let me know immediately, thank you!

## Why publish statistics?

For research purposes. Since I started publishing insight about my statistics, I started receiving many requests asking for more data, so here is all of the data. Such open data can be useful to PhD students, marketing researchers, statisticians, data enthusiasts.

If you own an app and want to add your data here, please check the link above, thanks!
