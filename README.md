# Google Play statistics

Google Play statistics of a few Android apps. Click [here](https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/google-play-statistics/archive/master.zip) to download the whole data (about 2 gigabytes).

I believe this data does not contain any confidential information, but if you find any please let me know immediately, thank you!

If you find interesting things, publish a thesis or build something using the data, please [let me know](http://nrw.free.fr), that would be great :-)

## Why publish statistics?

1. To allow data enthusiasts to find interesting patterns in your data. For instance, would you be interested in knowing that a particular version of your app triggered a sudden ratings drop with users that have a particular screen size? That can help you identify problems and make your app better.
2. Since I started publishing insight about my statistics, I started receiving many requests from researchers, statisticians and PhD students asking for more data, so here is all of it.

If you own an app and want to add your statistics here, you are very welcome, please check [Publish my Google Play statistics](https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/publish-my-google-play-statistics) or contact me, thanks!
